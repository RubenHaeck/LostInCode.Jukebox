# Blazor WebAssembly Playground  
_A lightweight exploration project powered by **Blazor WebAssembly** and assisted by **GitHub Copilot**._

## 🚀 Overview
This repository contains a small experimental project built with **Blazor WebAssembly**, Microsoft's client-side web UI framework based on C#.  
The goal of this project is to explore:

- Modern Blazor WebAssembly development
- Real-time code suggestions and generation with **GitHub Copilot**
- Component architecture, routing, and state management in Blazor
- Integration and debugging workflow inside Visual Studio

It is not intended for production use — this is purely a learning sandbox.

## ✨ Features

- **Client-side C# execution** running entirely in the browser
- **Interactive UI components** showcasing Blazor’s event handling & data binding
- **Copilot-assisted code snippets**, component generation, and refactoring
